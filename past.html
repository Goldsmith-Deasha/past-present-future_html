<h2>Wesleys younger Years</h2>

<p>Wesleys family is made up of his mom, his step-father, his sister and his dog. He is very into his trumpet and percussion playing. For example, he is going to spend the entire summer doing the NFL of marching band. He moved to Greenville right before his freshman year last year. He is about to move into a house, but the City of Mauldin is being stupid and won't let his family put up an 8 foot fence and they can only have a 6 foot. But hopefully he will be in a house by christmas.</p>

<p>Wesley is trying to find a job, but he is only 15 so he is limited in his options. Wesley is also very knowledgeable about North Korea and their human rights violations, and he wants to be a part of a team one summer that helps North Korean defectors become safe in the South. Currently thought, his life consists of school, band and homework. He will have some free time during the week, but most of that goes towards practicing audition material for getting into DCI.</p>
